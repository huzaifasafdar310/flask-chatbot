🔹 Step 1: Define the Scope (HR/FAQ Bot Example)

Your bot should handle two types of queries:

Static FAQs → like “What is the company policy on overtime?”

These answers come from a pre-written knowledge base (text/JSON/CSV).

Dynamic queries → like “How many leaves do I have left?”

These need logic + data from a database (e.g., user records).

🔹 Step 2: Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (simple web app with APIs)

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (or Streamlit for quicker prototyping)

NLP: HuggingFace (to classify intent), spaCy (optional for NER like dates, names, etc.)

AI: Groq (LLaMA 3) or OpenAI (for natural answers)

Database: SQLite/MySQL (for employee-specific queries like leave balance)

🔹 Step 3: Workflow

User asks a question in chat.
Example: “What is the leave policy?”

Intent Detection

Classify: Is this an FAQ or Employee-specific query?

(HuggingFace intent classifier or simple keyword search at first).

Knowledge Retrieval / DB Query

If FAQ → search in FAQ dataset.

If Dynamic → fetch from database (e.g., leave balance = 5 days).

AI Layer (Groq/OpenAI)

Pass query + retrieved answer into LLM → make reply more natural.

Example: “You currently have 5 casual leaves left. Do you want me to show how to apply them?”

Send response back to frontend → render in chat UI.
